[epimixr](https://github.com/sbfnk/epimixr) is an `R` package that uses social mixing matrices to conduct epidemiological analysis. It contains the functions `adjust_immunity` (to adjust population-level immunity by mixing patterns as described in [Funk et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-019-1413-7)), `project_immunity` (to estimate immunity based on vaccination data by projecting forward from a given starting point of age-specific susceptibility) and `epidemic_age_dist` (to estimate the age distribution of an epidemic, see also the [finalsize](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/finalsize/) package which implements more functionality to perform the same task).
